        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> My name is Sophia. I am 11 years old right now. My birthday is september 2 2010 (90210) My favorite colors are black and red. I have some hobbies. I like to play video games and draw. I alsoo like to sleep :).

           I have some friends. Their names are Gloriann, Gabriela, Aaliyah, Hailey, and Lovely. I've knownw Gloriann since pre-k. I've known Gabriela and Aaliyah since first grade and Hailey is Aaliyah's younger sister. I met her around 3rd or 4th grade. Me and Gloriann are really close though. Gloriann transferred from my school to another school but we still talk. I haven't seen her in close to 3 years. I always see Gabriela, Aaliyah, and Hailey at school and I spend time with them.

            Gabriela is really funny and I like her sense of humor. She doesn't get along with Aaliyah very much though. They always end up starting arguements. They end up calming down though. Aaliyah is organized  all the time. She likes things to be perfect, Hailey is another crackheaad. I know almost everything about Gloriann. Gloriann is a calm person. She is sometimes loud but not that much. Gloriann is a fun person to be around.
            
            
            I also have some things I would like to complete during my lifetime. I would like to be an artist.I've been drawing for years. I liked to practice drawing in my free times, or at lunch in school. Everyone says that i'm the best artist in the schol but they haven't met Gloriann. Gloriann can draw real good. I learned how to draw how I do now because of her. I'm really happy to have Gloriann. I also have another hobby. I like to play video games a lot. My favorite video games are Roblox or Genshin Impact. I also like to play Minecraft to. I really like to play Roblox though. It's a fun game. Me and Gloriann play it a lot.

            This is my profile app! I hope you enjoyed!.</p>
